# [Part 1.a. Introduction to React](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/introduction_to_react)

- [React Libarary](<[React](https://react.dev/)>)

#### The easiest way to get started by far is by using a tool called [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

- **$ npm create vite@latest part1-vite -- --template react** ->Create a application navigate to its directory and install the libraries
- **$ cd part1-vite**
- **$ npm install**
- **$npm run dev** -> The application is started as follows
- **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**

- Change main.jsx to:

```jsx
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);
```

- Change App.jsx to:

```jsx
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);
```

- The files App.css and index.css, and the directory assets may be deleted as they are not needed in our application right now.
- **$npm run dev** -> The application is started as follows
- **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**

## The create-react-app

- Instead of Vite you can also use the older generation tool [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) in the course to set up the applications.
- The most visible difference to Vite is the name of the application startup file, which is _index.js_ .

```
npm start		- creat-react-app - Old generation tool creat-react-app
npm run dev		- Vite            - The most visible difference to Vite is the name of the application startup file, which is index.js.
```

### Componet

- The file _App.jsx_ now defines a [React component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) with the name _App_ . The command on the final line of file _main.jsx_

#### Componet Static

```js
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ cd component_static
$ npm start
$ http://localhost:3000
```

#### index.html

- By default, the file _index.html_ doesn't contain any HTML markup that is visible to us in the browser:
- You can try adding there some HTML to the file. However, when using React, all content that needs to be rendered is usually defined as React components.

$ index.htm

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>React</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Renders its contents into the div-element, defined in the file index.html, having the id value 'root'.

#### index.js

$ index.js

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);
```

- The next files can be deleted: App.css, App.test.js, index.css, logo.svg, setupTests.js e reportWebVitals.js, they are not needed in our application.

#### App.js or App.jsx

There are a few ways to define functions in JavaScript. Here we will use [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), which are described in a newer version of JavaScript known as [ECMAScript 6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const), also called ES6.

The function defining the component may contain any kind of JavaScript code. Modify your component to be as follows:

$ App.js (Dynamic Component)

```js
const App = () => {
  console.log("Hello from component");
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello world</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

![ComponentStatic](.\part1\images\ComponentStatic1.png)

#### The first rule of frontend web development:

keep the console open all the time

#### It is also possible to render dynamic content inside of a component.

$ App.js (Dynamic Component)

```js
const App = () => {
  const now = new Date();
  const a = 10;
  const b = 20;
  console.log(now, a + b);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello world, it is {now.toString()}</p>
      <p>
        {a} plus {b} is {a + b}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};
export default App;
```

$ public\index.html - are the same of component static

### JSX

- It seems like React components are returning HTML markup. However, this is not the case. The layout of React components is mostly written using [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx). Although JSX looks like HTML, we are dealing with a way to write JavaScript. Under the hood, JSX returned by React components is compiled into JavaScript.
- After compiling, our application looks like this:

```js
const App = () => {
  const now = new Date();
  const a = 10;
  const b = 20;
  return React.createElement(
    "div",
    null,
    React.createElement("p", null, "Hello world, it is ", now.toString()),
    React.createElement("p", null, a, " plus ", b, " is ", a + b)
  );
};
```

- The compilation is handled by [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl/). Projects created with _create-react-app_ or _vite_ are configured to compile automatically. We will learn more about this topic in [part 7](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7) of this course.
- It is also possible to write React as "pure JavaScript" without using JSX. Although, nobody with a sound mind would do so.
- JSX is "[XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction)-like", which means that every tag needs to be closed. For example, a newline is an empty element, which in HTML can be written as follows:

```jsx
  <br>
```

- but when writing JSX, the tag needs to be closed:

```jsx
<br />
```

### Multiple Componentes

- folder: multiple_components

```html
public\index.html src\App.js src\index.js
```

### props: passing data to components

### Possible error message

### Some notes

...

```
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ cd component_static
$ npm start
$ http://localhost:3000
```

...

### Do not render objects

### Exercises 1.1.-1.2.

#### NPKILL

- **$ npx npkill** To clean the node_modules because the files size
- **$ npm install** After the clean we need to install all node_modules
- **$ npm start** After I can start the project, it starts automatically
